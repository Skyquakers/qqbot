# qqbot

A simple qqbot helping users searching docs in yuque.com/pixelcloud in case some of them don't know how to do it themselves.

## usage

1. Install `mirai console loader`, add `mirai-http-sdk` plugin, run ./mcl

2. login your qq in mcl console using `/login qq pwd`. You may need to pass captcha.

3. run this project.

## login

Automate login is tough in QQ. Artificially do it. And that's why this project is hard to be deployed on server.
